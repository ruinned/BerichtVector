1     Introduction

1.1    MISRA C

The original MISRA C Guidelines were published in April 1998 by the Motor Industry Re-
search Association in a document entitled "Guidelines For The Use Of The C Language
In Vehicle Based Software". In 2004, an updated version of this document was published
under the title "MISRA C:2004 Guidelines for the use of the C language in critical sys-
tems". In July 2007 a Technical Corrigendum was issued to address a number of issues
which required correction or clarification. This was incorporated into the base document
when MISRA C2 was reprinted in June 2008. Most recently in 2013, an updated version
of the MISRA C Guidelines was published under the title "MISRA C:2012 Guidelines for
the use of the C language in critical systems". There are therefore three versions of the
guidelines and these are now referred to as MISRA C:1998 (MISRA C1), MISRA C:2004
(MISRA C2) and MISRA C:2012 (MISRA C3).
Although derived from MISRA C2, MISRA C3 contains some significant changes. The
Guidelines are divided into Directives and Rules, and each is classified as either Advisory,
Required, or Mandatory. Code that is compliant with MISRA C2 will not necessarily be
compliant with MISRA C3 and code that is compliant with MISRA C3 will not necessarily
be compliant with MISRA C2.


1.2    The MISRA C:2012 Compliance Module

This document provides an introduction to the MISRA C:2012 Compliance Module (M3CM).
The M3CM module is designed to enforce compliance with the MISRA C:2012 program-
ming standard in conjunction with QA·C.
QA·C is a software tool that performs static analysis on C source code. Invariably a
process of configuration is required in order to introduce QA·C effectively to a particular
software development environment. It is important to have QA·C configured so as to
restrict the output of warning messages to those that are of particular concern. M3CM is
one such configuration, it configures QA·C to enforce compliance with the MISRA C:2012
coding guidelines.
QA·C is able to detect most of the statically detectable conditions identified in the MISRA
C:2012 guidelines (as well as many others). M3CM configures QA·C to identify issues
which are specific to those guidelines, and provides a cross-reference between the stan-
dard QA·C warning message(s) and the corresponding MISRA C:2012 guideline. Also
available is an HTML description of each guideline.
For some MISRA C:2012 coding standard guidelines which are not enforceable directly




COMPONENT MANUAL : M3CM 1.1.0             Page 1                        Programming Research Ltd.
by QA·C, additional checks are provided through a secondary-analysis program. These
checks are programmed using the analysis output files (.met files) generated by the QA·C
"primary analysis" process.
Some MISRA C:2012 rules, as noted in Section 6.6 of the guidelines, impose constraints
on the complete system rather than the code in a single translation unit. These require-
ments are enforced by the Cross-Module Analysis capability of QA·C.


1.3    Installation

For details of installation please refer to the PRQA Framework Installation Notes.
Please check the PRQA Framework Release Notes for the version of M3CM that is com-
patible with the installed version of QA·C.




COMPONENT MANUAL : M3CM 1.1.0             Page 2                       Programming Research Ltd.
2     M3CM Components

The M3CM compliance module introduces a number of additional components to your
QA·C installation which provide the following features:
    · A subset of the QA·C messages appropriate to enforcement of the MISRA C:2012
      guidelines.
    · A new message structure reflecting the MISRA C:2012 guidelines.
    · Secondary-analysis checks to enforce a number of the MISRA C:2012 guidelines.


2.1    Dataflow

Dataflow analysis is required for the enforcement of a number of MISRA guidelines. An
appropriate configuration for dataflow analysis will depend on factors such as the hard-
ware environment and the complexity of the code. These issues are discussed in the
dataflow reference manual. There are no configuration requirements specific to M3CM
enforcement.




COMPONENT MANUAL : M3CM 1.1.0            Page 3                      Programming Research Ltd.
3     Using M3CM

3.1    Directives and Rules

MISRA C:2012 defines 159 guidelines consisting of 16 directives and 143 rules. The
guidelines are grouped into a number of sections, for example Compilation and build,
Code design, Unused code, Types, Pointer type conversions.
The MISRA C:2012 document describes the distinction between rules and directives as
follows:
"A directive is a guideline for which it is not possible to provide the full description neces-
sary to perform a check for compliance. Additional information, such as might be provided
in design documents or requirements specifications, is required in order to be able to per-
form the check. Static analysis tools may be able to assist in checking compliance with
directives but tools may place widely different interpretations on what constitutes a non-
compliance."
"A rule is a guideline for which a complete description of the requirement has been pro-
vided. It should be possible to check that source code complies with a rule without need-
ing any other information. In particular, static analysis tools should be capable of checking
compliance with rules subject to the limitations described in Section 6.5."
M3CM describes directives as "Not Statically Enforceable (NSE)". Enforcement is pro-
vided for some directives but this may not be sufficient by itself to ensure compliance
in every situation. It should be noted that the percentage of enforcement indicated by
the Rule Enforcement report excludes all directives even though partial enforcement is
available for some of them.


3.2    Configuring M3CM for Conformance to C90 or C99

MISRA C:2012 rules are classified as being related to the C90 Language Standard, the
C99 Language Standard, or both (as described in Appendix F). By default, M3CM is
configured to produce messages for systems conforming to the C90 standard and in this
configuration, diagnostic messages will be triggered wherever a C99 feature is used.
If M3CM is to be used in a system conforming to C99 (or a subset of the additional features
in C99), a number of messages may be suppressed.
    · QA·C 8.1 has 19 messages which identify the use of C99 features: 0180, 0320,
      0604, 0617, 0618, 0850, 0930, 0945, 1011, 1018, 1027, 1030, 1031, 1051, 1052,
      1053, 1054, 1055, 1056. All these messages are prefixed with "[C99]":
    · QA·C 8.1 has 19 messages which identify a breach of a C90 "environmental limit":




COMPONENT MANUAL : M3CM 1.1.0               Page 4                        Programming Research Ltd.
      0410, 0609, 0611, 0612, 0614, 0639, 0647, 0715, 0739, 0776, 0778, 0810, 0815,
      0816, 0828, 0857, 0858, 0859, 0875. These are messages which identify potential
      limits on portability which apply in C90 but not in a C99 environment. All these
      messages contain the text "ISO:C90".


3.3    The QA·C Message System

Each MISRA C Guideline is classified as either Mandatory, Required or Advisory and this
classification is reflected in the structure of the message system. QA·C messages are
arranged in 10 levels. In M3CM the following levels are used.

   Level 0 : Information
   Level 4: MISRA Advisory Directives
   Level 5 : MISRA Advisory Rules
   Level 6 : MISRA Required Directives
   Level 7 : MISRA Required Rules
   Level 8 : MISRA Mandatory Rules

Level 0 contains informational messages, sub-messages and error recovery messages.
Levels 4 - 8 contain message groups corresponding to each MISRA C:2012 guideline,
divided into advisory, required and mandatory rules and directives. This separation allows
users to disable, for example, all advisory items in order to focus only on required and
mandatory guidelines.
A rule or directive may be enforced by
    · QA·C (primary analysis)
    · Dataflow analysis
    · Secondary Analysis
    · CMA (Cross-Module Analysis)
    · by some combination of these 4 elements.
The type of analysis used to enforce a given guideline is listed in the Cross Reference
Listing.


3.4    Mapping Messages to MISRA Directives and Rules

Some analysis messages are associated with more than one MISRA Guideline. This
occurs when:




COMPONENT MANUAL : M3CM 1.1.0             Page 5                      Programming Research Ltd.
    · The requirements of 2 MISRA guidelines overlap. For example, any violation of Rule
      11.7 ("A cast shall not be performed between pointer to object and a non-integer
      arithmetic type") will also violate Rule 1.3, or
    · The granularity of the condition identified by an analysis message does not coincide
      uniquely with a single MISRA Guideline. For example, message 2771 ("Definite:
      These pointers address different objects.") is mapped to both Rule 18.2 ("Subtrac-
      tion between pointers shall only be applied to pointers that address elements of the
      same array") and Rule 18.3 ("The relational operators and >= shall not be applied
      to objects of pointer type except where they point into the same object"), or
    · Violation of one rule may also result in violation of another. For example Rule 5.8
      ("Identifiers that define objects or functions with external linkage shall be unique")
      and Rule 5.9 ("Identifiers that define objects or functions with internal linkage should
      be unique").
The guideline or guidelines with which each message is associated will always be re-
ported in the "reference text". However, in the (few) situations where a message is as-
sociated with more than one guideline, it will only be specifically mapped to one of the
guidelines - the primary guideline. Where this situation occurs, any statistics relating to
the number of violations of any particular guideline may be slightly misleading.
It is also important to note that if a message which is mapped to more than one guideline
is suppressed, it will be suppressed for all the guidelines with which it is associated.

4    Global Checks

Cross-Module Analysis checks are required to fully implement a compliance modules rule
set. This analysis is normally only of significant value when the code from a complete
project is available for analysis.
For details of configuration and use of Cross-Module Analysis, please refer to the RCMA
Manual.
